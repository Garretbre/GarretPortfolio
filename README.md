Here are a few samples of my work in C# and .Net Framework

[Car Insurance](https://github.com/Garretbre/C-Projects/tree/main/CarInsurance)

[GroundHogsDay Drill](https://github.com/Garretbre/C-Projects/tree/main/Console%20Application%20Bool)

The first link is to my Car Insurance Application that will ask for your information just like any of the other car insurance companies. Process that information 
to calculate how much your insurance rate a month would be for car insurance. I am currently working to bring pictures and dynamic material to this project. I am 
excited to see where my coding will go with this project going forward to master my knowledge in C# and .Net Framework. My initial plan when I started this project 
was to change all of the backgrounds of the pages I did not succeed because I did not want to fall behind in my studies. I also wished to change the name of the Car 
Insurance to Just Monster Truck Insurance and add a video to the homepage. In my spare time I will be working on this Web Application and I hope you come back to see 
the growth in my coding skills.

The second link was one of my first projects I was passionate about when I started this specific course. I was not a huge fan jumping into C# this drill I am 
keeping in mind for future projects. I grew to enjoy all of the differant ways I could code with this course. This drill was about giving the user a choice to 
continue reliving groundhogs day or break free from the loop. Advising not to type in a number that would provide an infinite loop. All choices worked and made 
sense to me. Everytime I would get stuck I would think back to this drill and think to myself. How would I make this new project work so no matter what the user 
put into the code path the computer would be able to provide an answer?

Thank you for reading and remember to follow if you enjoy my work.

Thank you to the Tech Academy for helping me persue a job field I am passionate about.
